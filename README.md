This lab is a web mapping application that users can draw a polyline on the map and by clicking on the Simplify button the map would show the simplified polyline. They also can remove the polyline in order to draw a new polyline.  
In this lab Turf.js and one of its functions (Simplify) are used for spatial analysis in this web mapping application.
